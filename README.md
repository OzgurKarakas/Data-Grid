## Project Description
This project includes a data table application developed using React. The application provides an organized list of data using Syncfusion's Data Grid component. I used TypeScript to make the codes reliable and understandable. The data is taken from the json file at the base of the project. This JSON file contains the sample dataset loaded at the start of the application. Data is read through the Syncfusion Data Grid component and presented to the user in an orderly manner.

## - Search Filter
  Thanks to Syncfusion Data Grid's powerful filtering features, users can quickly navigate through large data sets. The search bar allows users to quickly find the data they want.

## - Dropdown Filter
 Drop-down filtering options within the drop-down menu allow them to classify data more specifically. 

## - Other Features

* Paging 
* Edit Toolbar (Add, Edit, Delete, Update, Cancel) 
* Edit Type (DropDownList)
